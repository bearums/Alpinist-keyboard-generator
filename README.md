Alpinist generates parametric keyboards with arbitrary numbers of keys on each row using Python's [cadquery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery)

The keyboards are hand wired and the plate is screwed to the case via countersink screws (by default M2). 

There is the option to put a small aviator connector on the front of the case.

As well as adding a box to house a microcontroller with optional LEDs and rotary encoder
